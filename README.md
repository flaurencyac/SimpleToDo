## Notes

A challenge that I had during the development of Simple ToDo was getting familiarized with the Android Studio interface and understanding the structure and inner workings of the Model View Controller. There were many concepts that I had run into before in my Object Oriented Programming class, like saving data to a file for persistence, using an adapter design pattern, widgets, and listeners, but actually getting to code them to this scale was eye-opening in that I got to understand how every class, method, interface, and widget worked together. Finally, more than anything, reviewing the UML diagram presented in the last module helped me visualize/internalize the app in its entirety, which really helped consolidate the concepts I learned from all the modules.
